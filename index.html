                        Hello there, and thank you for viewing my home page.
                        My name is <strong style="color: red;">Ido</strong>, and I'm here to make great things a reality.

                    I started to code before finishing elementry shcool.
                    In my early childhood I was participating at "Ron Vardi Center" gifted children program for 7 years, and participated in "Computer Ron", which was a voluntary student project dedicated to fixing old computers and donating them to charity.
                    I studied at Bar Ilan University youth program and finish my high school mathematics two years earlier.
                    I studied at Gymnasia Realit high school at Rishon Lezion in a gifted children class, and majored in Computer Science, Chemistery and Physics.
                    In my late teens, I solved 200+ Project Euler's algorithmic problems, and wrote 100+ articles in the Hebrew Wikipedia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    After Graduated from high school in 2011, I enlisted and served in an elite technology unit in the Intelligence Corps of the IDF, two years of them as an officer and a team leader.
                    I Led 2 teams of 4-10 soldiers which was responsible for high performance infrastructures and managed various projects.
                    I started to study computer science degree at the Open University in 2014.
                    I left the IDF in 2017 to continue my studies at Ben Gurion University of the Negev.
